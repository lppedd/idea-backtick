<p>
    This plugin allows wrapping and unwrapping text in backticks (<code>&#96</code>) via
    <em>intention actions</em>, while also <strong>supporting multiple carets</strong>.<br/>
    The idea was born because of the <strong>inaccessibility of the backtick symbol in
    Windows</strong> using the Italian keyboard configuration. That means one has to re-map the
    keyboard or has to copy-paste the symbol each time.
